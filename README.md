[![CI/CD](https://github.com/schollz/miditocv/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/schollz/miditocv/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Latest](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/schollz/miditocv?color=brightgreen&label=Release)](https://github.com/schollz/miditocv/releases/latest)

there are eight scenes. each scene is selected by TBD.

each scene has eight outputs. each output can be configured to a different mode. modes are selected holding `shift` and pressing one of the eight buttons.

The **bold** things are implemented.

The miditocv has [an online editor](https://my.miditocv.com) that you can use to test out your programs.

Yoctocore programs are based around a set of [callback functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)) that are run on specific routines.

### `volts` and `trigger`

For any function you can set the voltage, or you can raise a trigger. The voltage is a number between -5 and 10, and the trigger is a boolean. The trigger is used if any other events are linked. To set the voltage you set the global variable `volts`:

```lua
volts = 5
```

To set the trigger you set the global variable `trigger`:

```lua
trigger = true
```

The trigger will get reset to `false` after the trigger is used.

You can also return values from the functions, which is useful in debugging as it will printed in the online code editor.

### `out[i].volts`

The `out[i].volts` is a table that can be used to set the voltage for a specific output. The `i` is the output number (1-8). The voltage is a number between -5 and 10. For example, if you are writing code for output 1, but want to change the voltage on output 8 you can write:

```lua
out[8].volts = 5
```

which will set the voltage on output 8 to 5V.

The code from any output can change the voltage for any other output. When this voltage *changes* it will *override* any other voltage on any other output.

### `shift` and `button[i]`

The state of buttons is accessible at any time in lua code using the `shift` and `button[i]` global state variables. They are boolean values.

```lua
if shift then print("shift on") else print("shift off") end
if button[1] then print("button 1 on") else print("button 1 off") end
```

### `on_beat(on)`

This function is called every time a beat is detected. The `on` is a boolean for whether it is on the top of the beat or the bottom.

```lua
bpm = 120 -- define bpm
local voltage_increase = 0
function on_beat(on)
    voltage_increase = voltage_increase + 0.1
    if voltage_increase > 10 then
        voltage_increase = 0
    end
    volts = voltage_increase
    trigger = on
end
```

This function is special, in that it *can be linked to a clock output*, but if it is not linked to a clock output it will run at the tempo defined by the `bpm` variable.

### `on_knob(value)`

This function exposes the knob events. The `value` is the knob value (0.0-1.0), the `shift` is a boolean of whether the shift button is pressed.

```lua
function on_knob(value)
    if shift then
        volts = value
    else
        volts = value * 5.0
    end
end
```

### `on_button(value)`

This function exposes the button event. The `value` is `true` if the button is pressed, else `false`, and the `shift` is a boolean of whether the shift button is pressed.

```lua
function on_button(value)
    if shift then
        trigger = value
    else
        volts = value and 5 or 0
    end
end
```

### `on_note_on(channel,note,velocity)`, `on_note_off(channel,note)`

These functions expose the MIDI note on and note off events. The `channel` is the MIDI channel, the `note` is the MIDI note, and the `velocity` is the MIDI velocity.

```lua
function on_note_on(channel,note,velocity)
    volts = (note-60.0)/12.0
    trigger = true
end

function on_note_off(channel,note)
    trigger = false
end
```

### `on_cc(channel,cc,value)`

This function exposes the MIDI CC events. The `channel` is the MIDI channel, the `cc` is the MIDI CC number, and the `value` is the MIDI value.

```lua
function on_cc(channel,cc,value)
    volts = value/127.0
end
```

### `on_key_pressure(channel,key,pressure)`

This function exposes the MIDI key pressure events. The `channel` is the MIDI channel, the `key` is the MIDI key, and the `pressure` is the MIDI pressure.

```lua
function on_key_pressure(channel,key,pressure)
    volts = pressure/127.0
end
```

### `on_channel_pressure(channel,pressure)`

This function exposes the MIDI channel pressure events. The `channel` is the MIDI channel, and the `pressure` is the MIDI pressure.

```lua
function on_channel_pressure(channel,pressure)
    if (channel == 1) then
        volts = pressure/127.0
    end
end
```

### `on_pitch_bend(channel,pitch)`

This function exposes the MIDI pitch bend events. The `channel` is the MIDI channel, and the `pitch` is the MIDI pitch as a 14-bit number.

```lua
function on_pitch_bend(channel,pitch)
    volts = pitch/16383.0
end
```

## Code Helper Functions

### `er(k,n,w)`

This function generates a sequins sequence for euclidean rhythms. The `k` is the number of hits, the `n` is the number of steps, and the `w` is the rotation of the sequence.

```lua
riddim = er(3,8,0) -- generates a euclidean rhythm with 3 hits in 8 steps
function on_beat(on)
    if on then
        trigger = riddim()
    end
end
```

### `to_cv(value)`

This function is called every time a value is sent to the CV output. The `value` is the voltage that is being sent to the CV output. The value can be a MIDI note (values between 10 and 127) or it can be a voltage (values between -5 and 10) or it can be a note name (e.g. "c4").

```lua
volts = to_cv(60) -- sets the voltage to 0V
volts = to_cv("a5") -- sets the voltage to 1.75V
volts = to_cv(0) -- sets the voltage to 0V
```

### S - A Minimal Sequencing Library

`S` is a library designed to build sequencers and arpeggiators with minimal scaffolding using Lua tables. Originally designed by [Trent Gill](https://monome.org/docs/norns/reference/lib/sequins), it provides a simple, extensible interface for creating complex patterns with ease.

This document introduces the basics of `S`. For advanced techniques, see the extended reference.


#### Syntax and Description

| **Syntax**                   | **Description**                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `my_seq = S{a, b, c, ...}`   | Create a sequence of values (any data type, including nested sequences).            |
| `my_seq()`                   | Call the sequence, advancing by the step size (default is 1) and returning a value. |
| `my_seq:step(x)`             | Change the step size to `x`.                                                        |
| `my_seq:select(n)`           | Select index `n` for the next call to `my_seq()`.                                   |
| `my_seq[x] = y`              | Update the value at index `x` to `y` (does not change the length).                  |
| `my_seq:settable(new_table)` | Replace the sequence's table with `new_table` (changes length and resets index).    |

#### Flow Modifiers

Flow modifiers work exclusively on nested sequences, offering additional control.

| **Syntax**        | **Description**                                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `my_seq:every(n)` | Produce a value every `n`th call.                                         |
| `my_seq:times(n)` | Produce values only the first `n` times it's called.                      |
| `my_seq:count(n)` | Produce `n` values from the inner sequence before returning to the outer. |
| `my_seq:all()`    | Iterate through all inner sequence values before returning to the outer.  |
| `my_seq:reset()`  | Reset all flow modifiers and indices.                                     |

#### Examples

```lua
note_vals = S{'c4', 'd4', 'e4', S{'g4', 'a4', 'b4'}} -- plays c4, d4, e4, then g4, a4, b4
note_vals = S{'c4', 'd4', 'e4', S{'g4', 'a4', 'b4'}:every(3)}:step(3) -- Advance by 3, play inner sequence every 3rd iteration
note_vals = S{'c4', 'd4', 'e4', S{'g4', 'a4', 'b4'}:count(10)} -- Inner sequence iterates 10 times
note_vals = S{'c4', 'd4', 'e4', S{'f4', 'g4', 'a4'}:times(6)} -- Inner sequence iterates as normal but stops after 6 iterations
note_vals = S{'c4', 'd4', 'e4', S{'f4', 'g4', 'a4'}:all()} -- Inner sequence plays all values before releasing focus
```


## Calibration

*Note:* This works on windows only.

The miditocv core is calibrated using an NI USB-6009 device to read in the voltages while manipulating the raw values to obtain a calibration curve for adjusting the final voltage.

To get started, you will need nidaqmx + drivers:

```
sudo -H python3 -m pip install --break-system-packages nidaqmx
sudo -H python3 -m nidaqmx installdriver # install everything
```

Restart the computer and make sure to DISABLE "Secure Boot".

To see if it installed correctly:

```
> nidaqmxconfig
```
